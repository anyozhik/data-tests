# data-tests
We have made several tests to choose the best product design. In our dataset we have information about orders, their status, profit, type (desktop/mobile) and tests. 

Aim is to range all tests and evaluate their effectiveness.

Objectives:
- to create a rating of positiveness for all tests based on its results;
- to find tests with the highest ARPPU according to type (desktop/mobile) and positiveness test results;
- to find tests with the highest ARPPU according to price group and positiveness test results.
